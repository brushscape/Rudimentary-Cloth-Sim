This project allows the user to grab points on a 'cloth' and drag it around. Any point that you click on will turn into an anchor that is not affected by gravity. The default number of anchors is 2 (though this can be changed at the top of the MassSpringSystem script). If two anchors are already set and you click on a new point, the anchor that was set the longest ago will be dropped to make room for the new anchor. 

The physics model that is used to make this cloth is relatively simple. Each point on the mesh is connected to all points adjacent to it with springs. 

This 'cloth' is by no means perfect. It stretches a lot, the points do not collide with themselves, and the points can dance sometimes. I hope to fix these problems in further iterations
